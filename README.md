*NeuroScale_Trainer*

Image upscaler transformer seq2seq, based on [NeuroSync](https://github.com/AnimaVR/NeuroSync_Trainer_Lite) - but for images.

Use case : Image compression and storage with retreival by tiny little thumbnail - super useful, think about it !

Can take images or video to create an upscale from 64x64 to 256x256 in colour.

Really good early results, time to scale up.
